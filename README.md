Wakanda Forever

My name is Leah. It's pronounce "lay-uh", not "lee-yuh". Think of Princess Leia, from Star Wars.
I am a United States Airman, and I love it. Uncle Sam can be demanding at times, but he takes care of me and my family, and for that, I am more than happy to serve my Country during these turbulent times. I work in IT and am working on my B.B.A. in Cyber Security, however, Englsih is my first love and passion. After achieving my B.B.A in Cyber Security, I want to get my M.A. in English. I believe that the two degrees coupled with my military service and a few certifications sprinkled in will set me apart and make me competitive in the Civilian Sector when I choose to get out.
